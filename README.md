<h1>Wifi-Grabber</h1>
<p>This is a simple script which utilizes the 'scapy' module to sniff beacon frames in your vicinity and extract useful information from 
these packets. Wifi name, strength and MAC addresses are the intended outputs for this project. As of now, it only prints SSIDs.</p>

<p>Scapy comes bundled with BT5 and kali 1.0/2.0. By default the script hops through channel 1 to 14, staying for 3 seconds on each channel.</p>

** UPDATE 20-03-10`6 ** Added a seperate script for windows 7 and onwards; wifi-grabber-windows.py
